# StockSense

StockSense is a stock price prediction system that uses machine learning to perform automatic stock trading. We aim to explore the possibilities of multi-stock prediction and trading, and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.

This project is a part of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" at National Tsing Hua University.
